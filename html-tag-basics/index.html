    <!-- This is the structure of a comment block in html files everything in this structure is NOT considered part of any content of any web page
    
        Most tags in html are done in pairs opening and closing tags
        The opening tag indicates the tag instruction to the browser
        The closing tag terminates the tag block. 
        The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag with the addition of a slash (/) before the tag name.
        On the html tag, it is useful to use a parameter to indicate the default character set to use for interpreting the type language character set.-->

        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
            <!--This is the coding block for your content on your web page-->
            <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line 
                in your displayed web page on the browser. The browser does not 
                display your content in the physical style of how you entered your code in your 
                html file.</p>
                <p>This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start a new line.</p>
                <!-- Create a new ordered list. Crate a new unordered list. Items in the list are li tags -->
                <!--If you wish to use a component of a reversed tag (or the whole tag), you would be in trouble
                    just using the tag. You can use special character strings to represent components of a tag such
                    as the < (&lt) and the > (&gt) symbol-->
                <h3>List tags &ltol&gt, and &ltul&gt.</h3>

                    <li>Add extension Live Server for Go Live</li>
                    <li>Close and reopen VS-Code</li>
                    <li>Look at the bottom right corner on the blue status line for Go Live</li>
                    <li>This will run your page from VS-Code</li>
                    <li>Alter your page and save the file. Your browser will automatically be updated.</li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>This is an unordered list.</li>
                    <li>Default display is a bulleted list.</li>
                    <li>We will see later how to remove these bullets.</li>
                </ul>

                <!--This is a anchor tag often referred to as the link tag.
                One should NOT use the term link tag because there is actually 
                a <link> tag used in the <head> section.
                This tag can take you to a different location whether it
                be a different website, different page in the current website
                or a different position on the current page.
            
                Paremeters href point to the desired location.
                Target indicates how to the browser page display option.
                Default is same display page. _blank will use a new window tab. -->
